Living in Taipei, Taiwan - I spend all my time on these things:
<ul class="dashed">
  <li>working as a localization project manager in the daytime.</li>
  <li>working on a 30,000+ word translation project.</li>
  <li>finding the way forward in my life.</li>
  <li>reading 《再想一下：好決策的關鍵思考術》, the Traditional Chinese version of <i>Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counterintuition</i> by Michael J. Mauboussin.</li>
  <li>reading <i>Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time</i> by Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz.</li>
  <li>refining this blog.</li>
</ul>
