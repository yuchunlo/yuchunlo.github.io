Living in Taipei, Taiwan - I spend all my time on these things:

* working as a localization project manager in the daytime.
* working on a 30,000+ word translation project.
* finding the way forward in my life.
* reading 《再想一下：好決策的關鍵思考術》, the Traditional Chinese version of *Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counterintuition* by Michael J. Mauboussin.
* reading *Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time* by Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz.
* refining this blog.
