Living in Taipei, Taiwan - I spend all my time on these things:
- keeping learning by reading, talking with people and deliberately practicing.
- working as a localization project manager in the daytime.
- working as a freelance translator at night and on weekends.
- working out every other day.
- sharing great things with the world via this blog.
- participating in Toastmasters.

This page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers") and his [/now](http://nownownow.com/) project. If you have your own site, [you should make one](http://nownownow.com/about "about nownownow.com") too.
