Living in Taipei, Taiwan - I spend all my time on these things:
<ul class="dashed">
  <li>working as a localization project manager in the daytime.</li>
  <li>working as a freelance translator at night and on weekends.</li>
  <li>building translyst, a translation platform with Python.</li>
  <li>sharing great things with the world via this blog.</li>
</ul>
This page was inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a> and his <a href="http://nownownow.com/">/now</a> project. If you have your own site, <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">you should make one</a> too.
