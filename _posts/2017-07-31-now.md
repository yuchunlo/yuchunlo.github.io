Living in Taipei, Taiwan - I spend all my time on these things:
<ul class="dashed">
  <li>working on some side projects.</li>
  <li>working as a localization project manager in the daytime.</li>
  <li>working as a freelance translator at night and on weekends.</li>
  <li>sharing great things with the world via this blog.</li>
</ul>

This page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers") and his [/now](http://nownownow.com/) project. If you have your own site, [you should make one](http://nownownow.com/about "about nownownow.com") too.
