Living in Taipei, Taiwan - I spend all my time on these things:
- working on some side projects.
- working as a localization project manager in the daytime.
- working as a freelance translator at night and on weekends.
- reading 《競合策略：商業運作的真實力量》, the Traditional Chinese version of *Co-Opetition* by Adam M. Brandenburger and Barry J. Nalebuff.
- sharing great things with the world via this blog.

This page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers") and his [/now](http://nownownow.com/) project. If you have your own site, [you should make one](http://nownownow.com/about "about nownownow.com") too.
