Living in Taipei, Taiwan - I spend all my time on these things:
- keeping learning by reading, talking with people and deliberately practicing.
- working as a localization project manager in the daytime.
- working as a freelance translator at night and on weekends.
- working out every other day.
- sharing great things with the world via this blog.
- participating in Toastmasters.
